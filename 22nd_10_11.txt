---Module 1 

SDLC - Software + Development + Life Cycle 

Software --- fb ,whatsapp , gstore,map 
		benifts 
			communicate , share
			life easy
		Set of programs that have some specific purpose 

	develope - phares/stages/steps/cycle
 		
Software developement is not only doing single task but it includes set of phares/task

	6 phares

	1. REquirement gathering  - gather the requiremenmt from client/user
	2. Analysis - Analyse each reqirement in detail
	3. Desgining -How it looks 
	4. Coding/implentation/development - coding
	5. Testing - validate/check
	6 . Maintainance - to maintain

SRS - System Requirement Specification 
Document 
	Project Description 
	Module Description 
	Scope/Features
	out of scope
	Requirements -Functional & Non - Functional 
		Functional - features/functionality of applcation eg. whatapp (chat,share,status.calling,payment)
		non functional  - apart from functionality e.g whatsapp (time to taking to load,  easy to use , response time,no of user handle at a time ,compatibile Performance,load,security,stress ,comatibility)

	Tools and Technology used 
		Front end
		back end
		database 
		Network
		
Lab task : google - SRS document of E-commerce ,social media

SDLC --- phares ka arrangement 
 1. sequential model
		Waterfall model 
		V model (verification and validation)

 2. iterative model 
		Spiral 
		iterative & incremental model
		agile model

Testing methodogies 
1. Waterfall 
	requirement is less
	small project
	bugs found at very later so 
 
2. agile 
	big project
	project starts with samll requirement .
	later on can have more requiments but initaly all requimement must know .

	small time interval ,test signle intaval 
	Social Media 
		User module
		Media  - reels,videos ....
		Sharing
		Advaterminsetn
		
	1-15 days(sprint - time interval in agile ) - TI1 -- User Module 
	16-30 days TI2  -- Media 
	30 - 45 days TI3 - sharing ,advantiment 
	
	havily depends on customer 

29th Dec

	Agile Menifesto 4
	12 principles 

	Testing ?
		check ,work 
		process , 
		evaluate 
		functionaltiy
		user requirment
		satishfaction

	Objectives ?
		1. find error/defect/bug
		2. check requirement
		3. User satishfaction
		4. Quality 
	
	functionality & non functional 
		What does - functionality
		How - non functionality 
		both are equally important
	
	3. Iterative and Incremental Model 

		1. analysis - design - implentation - testing
REquirement	2. analysis - design - implentation - testing
		3. analysis - design - implentation - testing
		4. analysis - design - implentation - testing	

	4. V Model - Verification and Validation Model
	5. Spiral - complex and big project 
		  - initlial requirement 
		  - Risk indetification 
		 - infinite 
	6. XP -		agile part 

	
WHEN TO START and When to Stop?
	Start ?
		1. At the begining of project
		2. when requirement are fixed
		3. As soon as possible
		
		Testing activities

Key Principles of Testing
- exhuastive testing is impossible 
       combination of each condition or value is not feasible e.g c_no check 
- Early Testing
      start testing as early as possible 
- Pestiside paradox 
		Review and revised your test cases periodically .
- Testing shows presence of defect 
	 porbebility of error/defect arise may reduced but doesn' gurenteed thr is no defect 
-Absence of error fallacy 
		must defect free and fulfill client requirement
-Defect clusting
		small module may contain more defect then bigger one
-Testing context depended
		


	Errors - defects - failure 

error - human mistake
defect - deviation from expected to actual result 
		diffrence between expected and actual result

Lab task : fundamentals of Software testing interview questions 
2. peer to peer 


RISK -> possilbity of failure 
		types 
1. Process oriented  - process 
2. Product oriented  ---  msoffice 
3. project risk ---  topsERP --

Roles and Responsiblity ---> 
	Software Tester/Software Test Engineer		---- > To test product , To design the test case ,execute the test case , to log the defect 
	Test Manager/Test Leader/Test Analyst  ---> Test plan document , test conditions/scenario , work allocation ,foloww up , Review  
QA-Quality Assurance  -  Process ,review , prevention 
QC - Quality Control - prodct , actual testing ,finding 

 test cases - documeten specify how/detail of test condition , test scripts - script test condtion- test cases - automate -manual  , and test data - 


Lab task : Read all the topics -error/defect/failure - sdlc-QA/QC - Roles - Risk - Priciples

		iii) Test Enviroment setup  --- system set -software installation-tools 
		iV)Test case design  -- how to test ,detail 
		v) Test case implementation/Execution - execute -log pass/fail
		vi)Test clouser  - all test case execution 
		vii) Test reporting - report lesson learnt
