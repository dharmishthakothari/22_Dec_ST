Software developement is not only doing single task but it includes set of phares/task

	6 phares

	1. REquirement gathering  - gather the requiremenmt from client/user
	2. Analysis - Analyse each reqirement in detail
	3. Desgining -How it looks 
	4. Coding/implentation/development - coding
	5. Testing - validate/check
	6 . Maintainance - to maintain

SDLC --- phares ka arrangement 
 1. sequential model
		Waterfall model 
		V model (verification and validation)

 2. iterative model 
		Spiral 
		iterative & incremental model
		agile model

Testing methodogies 
1. Waterfall 
	requirement is less
	small project
	bugs found at very later so 
 
2. agile 
	big project
	project starts with samll requirement .
	later on can have more requiments but initaly all requimement must know .

	small time interval ,test signle intaval 
	Social Media 
		User module
		Media  - reels,videos ....
		Sharing
		Advaterminsetn
		
	1-15 days(sprint - time interval in agile ) - TI1 -- User Module 
	16-30 days TI2  -- Media 
	30 - 45 days TI3 - sharing ,advantiment 
	
	havily depends on customer

	Agile Menifesto 4
	12 principles 

	Testing ?
		check ,work 
		process , 
		evaluate 
		functionaltiy
		user requirment
		satishfaction

	Objectives ?
		1. find error/defect/bug
		2. check requirement
		3. User satishfaction
		4. Quality 
	
	functionality & non functional 
		What does - functionality
		How - non functionality 
		both are equally important
	
	3. Iterative and Incremental Model 

		1. analysis - design - implentation - testing
REquirement	2. analysis - design - implentation - testing
		3. analysis - design - implentation - testing
		4. analysis - design - implentation - testing	

	4. V Model - Verification and Validation Model
	5. Spiral - complex and big project 
		  - initlial requirement 
		  - Risk indetification 
		 - infinite 
	6. XP -		agile part 

	
WHEN TO START and When to Stop?
	Start ?
		1. At the begining of project
		2. when requirement are fixed
		3. As soon as possible

Key Principles of Testing
- exhuastive testing is impossible 
       combination of each condition or value is not feasible e.g c_no check 
- Early Testing
      start testing as early as possible 
- Pestiside paradox 
		Review and revised your test cases periodically .
- Testing shows presence of defect 
	 porbebility of error/defect arise may reduced but doesn' gurenteed thr is no defect 
-Absence of error fallacy 
		must defect free and fulfill client requirement
-Defect clusting
		small module may contain more defect then bigger one
-Testing context depended
		


	Errors - defects - failure 

error - human mistake
defect - deviation from expected to actual result 
		diffrence between expected and actual result

Lab task : fundamentals of Software testing interview questions

Lab task : Read Testing Levels 

21st Jan
   Testing Levels 
      Unit Testing  ---To test individual component or module -- Developer - Whitebox 
	  Integration    -- To test intaraction between 2/more coponenent/module - dala flow --DEveloper/Tester --							Black+White
						Approach (Tops-down , Bottom-Up and big-bang)
							Upper modules are ready to integrate/test but lower modules are not ready to integrate then we are using dummy module called stub .
							Bottom module are ready to tegrate/test but upper modles are not ready then we are using dummy moduled calle driver .
							All module must be ready and test simultanesally 

	  System   		--  To test whole system as one . 
						Individual 	QA /team 
						Black box testing
						Functional and Non-function Testing

	  Acceptance --		Accouring to client requirement are satishfied/business needs 
						QA/cusotmers
						Alpha and Beta

username /password valid --expected --login successfuly  actual - login sucessfull pass
username/password invalid -- expected --error actual -- login successfully - fail 

Actual = Expected ---pass
Actual!=Expected -- Fail

2nd Feb

Functional Testing --- To check functionality of system , all functionality of system/application working or not
                   --- What system does 
                  --- eg. gmail ... componse mail , inbox , draft, thresh
Non Functionaltiy ---Apart from functionaltiy , system working properly or not , performance testing 
					 load testing , usability testing , compatiblity testing (OS , browser , xsfdsd
                  ---How system does .
					--- load time ,responce time ,security , easy to use 


4th Feb 
     Test Design Techniques 
			1. Black box testing
					when we don't internal structure of application , we know about the input and output of the application
					Generally tester are doing black box testing .
					This technique is widely use for regession,acceptance and system testing.
				Techniques
					i -- EP - Equivallance Partition  --- age (18-55) 
								18,19,20,21,22.....55
								1,2,3,4.....17
								56,57,58,....120
								not fesible 
								partition ---valid and invalid 
								valid (18-55)   ---- 45 
								invalid (<18)   ---- 15  --- error/defect i will try to test with more values 10,-18
								invalid (>55)   ----109 
					ii--BVA --- Boundary Value Analysis ---age (18-55)
									lower boundry-1,lower boudry ----upper bourdry,upper boudry+1
									17,18 ---55,56
	
					iii)Desicion Table --- 
								based on certain condition we have to take decision 
						condition1   -----   condition2			response
						 True					True			Yes
						 True					False			No
						 False					True			No
						 False					False			No

					iv) State transition testing ---Lab task 

								

			2. White box testing
					knowledge of internal structure
					path,loops,security ,unit testing 
			3. Gray box testing

---Test Levels
---Test Desgining Techniques 
			1. Black Box testing
					i)  Equivallance Partition
					ii) Boundry Value Analysis
					iii) Decision Table 
					iv) State transition 
			2.White Box testing
					Testing with knowledge of internal structure 
					Developer or tester who knows coding/internal structure 
					--all path/conditions/code are execution
					--unit testing
					techniques
					i)Path Coverage
					ii)Statement Coverage
					iii)Branch Coverage
					iv) Condition Coverage

		3. Gray Box Testing
			limited knowledge of internal structure 
			advantage of white and black 
				
		Experienced based techniques
				Mainly focus/depends on tester's knowledge and skill .
				limited requirement 

				i)Error guessing  --- based on past experience ,past project , we know the week area,we are guessing the error 
				ii)Exploratory --- simultanouesly learn,design test case and test/execute the application 
			    iii)Ad -hoc -- informal/unstructure ,no formal test cases or document

Time limited, skill tester and less risk 
do simutaneous test case design and execution - 


REGRESSION TESTING -- To check exsting functionality doesn't effect due to new functionality added.
					 -- Due to code changes , new functionality added or performance issue fix ,already working software doen't not affected 
					e.g Whatapp --due to status,channel added feature , already working (calling/chating) does not affected .
					Rerunning already passed Test cases

1 What is Testing
2. What is Test Plan
3. Which are Level of Testing?
4. Diffretiate Unit and Integration Testing.
5. What is Test cases ? Why it is used?Which are the fields of test cases?
6. Differentiate Alpha and Beta testing .
7. Responsibility of tester
8. Benifit of Independent tester
9. What is diff between test case and test scenarioes?
10. Which are the testing activies?

White Box 
		Statement Coverage
		Path coverage
		Desicion coverage
		Branch Coverage
		-Developer - Security holes and all stmt/program stmt/condition must executes.
Grey Box 
	   expreienced based testing
			error guessing
			ad hoc testing
			exploratory testing
Regression Testing --- 
				widely used terminology 
			
11th Feb
  --- Regression- already test case passes 
                - time constraints --- test cases 1000 --
				How to select regression test cases ....
				1. Retest all
				2. Based on Priority 
				3. Based on Risk 

---Retesting/Confirmation Testing
 Lab Task : regression vs Retesting

			Execute passed test cases is doing in regression to check/confirm due to
            i. updatation
			ii) New feature added
            iii)Performance fixes
           does not affect my working functionality .
